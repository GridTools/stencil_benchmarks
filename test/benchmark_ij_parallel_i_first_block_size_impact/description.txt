the block size impact plots are based on the results we got
when using IJ tiling, temporal storages, and i-first strategy.

The plots are grouped into domain sizes. The script iterates through 
all the results for one specific domain size, and blocksize in I and J.

The best result (thread count is the only remaining variable) for 
each stencil is stored. Afterwards we build the average bandwidth 
of all the basic stencils with the fixed blocksize and domain size. 
This value will be used in the heatmap plot.
