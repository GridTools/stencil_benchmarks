performance counters of the copy kernel, showing the results for 4 different runs for a large number of block sizes.

upper row:

left:  unaligned storage, OpenMP schedule(static, 1)
right: unaligned storage, OpenMP schedule(static)

lower row:

left:  aligned storage (first element of each row aligned to 32 elements, i.e. 256 bytes), OpenMP schedule(static, 1)
right: aligned storage (first element of each row aligned to 32 elements, i.e. 256 bytes), OpenMP schedule(static)

basic code structure:

#pragma omp for collapse(2) schedule(static)
for (j-blocks) {
  for (i-blocks) {
    for (k in block)
      for (j in block)
#pragma omp simd
#pragma vector nontemporal
        for (i in block)
           dst[index] = src[index];
  }
}
